# Better Commits

This is my version of a CLI tool that is meant to help you write better commits, this tool helps you write your commits based on the convetional commits guideline.

### How it works?

There are a total of 6 steps to create a conventional commit 

1. Select the type of change that you're committing 
2. What is the scope of this change (user, admin, etc.) the user can select none
3. Select a gitmoji for the commit, or the user can select none
4. Write a short, imperative tense description of the change
5. Provide a longer description of the change
6. List any breaking changes or issues closed by this change
